# Contributing

Thanks for considering contributing to this extension! Since it is an open source
product, its successful further development depends largely on improving and
optimizing it together.

The development of this extension follows the official
[TYPO3 coding standards](https://github.com/TYPO3/coding-standards). To ensure the
stability and cleanliness of the code, various code quality tools are used and most
components are covered with test cases. For continuous integration, we use GitHub Actions.
